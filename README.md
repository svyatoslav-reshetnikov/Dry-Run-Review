### Dry-Run Review
## Question 1
What have you learned recently about iOS development? How did you learn it? Has it changed your approach to building apps?
## Question 2
Can you talk about a framework that you've used recently (Apple or third-party)? What did you like/dislike about the framework?
## Question 3
Describe how you would construct a Twitter feed application (here is an example of Udacity's Twitter feed) that at minimum can display a company's Twitter page. Please include information about any classes/structs that you would use in the app. Which classes/structs would be the model(s), the controller(s), and the view(s)?
## Question 4
Describe some techniques that can be used to ensure that a UITableView containing many UITableViewCell is displayed at 60 frames per second.
## Question 5
Imagine that you have been given a project that has this ActorViewController. The ActorViewController should be used to display information about an actor. However, to send information to other ViewControllers, it uses NSUserDefaults. Does this make sense to you? How would you send information from one ViewController to another one?
## Question 6
Imagine that you have been given a project that has this GithubProjectViewController. The GithubProjectViewController should be used to display high-level information about a GitHub project. However, it’s also responsible for finding out if there’s network connectivity, connecting to GitHub, parsing the responses and persisting information to disk. It is also one of the biggest classes in the project.

How might you improve the design of this view controller?
## Question 7
If you were to start your iOS developer position today, what would be your goals a year from now?
